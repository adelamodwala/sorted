# sorted

An ASP.NET web service that allows for a demonstration and comparison between different sorting algorithms.

Primarily a Spring.NET project to demonstrate the use of various software design patterns that champion concepts such as loose coupling, modularity, sufficient abstraction, and code reuse.

The use of an IOC container (Spring) is essential to the idea of configuration over comparison while staying true to SOLID principles.

This project will evolve over time and may (most likely will) change in scope. The whole point of the exercise is to start with loose modules along a loose concept and the concretize the web service via minimal set-up and configuration.
